what are the main transcriptome and genomic disruption in breast cancer


Breast cancer is characterized by various transcriptomic and genomic disruptions, including: 

- Altered Gene Expression:

Overexpression of oncogenes (e.g., MYC, CCND1)
Downregulation of tumor suppressors (e.g., TP53, PTEN) 

-  altered splicing of genes like CD44, BRCA1, and TP53. 

Genomic Disruptions:

- Common Gene Mutations:

TP53 (tumor suppressor gene)
PIK3CA (oncogene in PI3K pathway)
BRCA1 and BRCA2 (DNA repair genes)
PTEN (tumor suppressor gene)
AKT1, GATA3, CDH1 (various roles in cell processes)

- Copy Number Variations:

Amplification of HER2/ERBB2 (defines HER2+ subtype)
Amplification of MYC, CCND1, and FGFR1
Deletion of RB1, PTEN, and CDKN2A


These genomic and transcriptomic disruptions often interact and contribute to the hallmarks of cancer, including sustained proliferation, evasion of growth suppressors, resistance to cell death, and activation of invasion and metastasis.
